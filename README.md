# Bank-Analysis-project

### Project overview
- created an interactive power BI dashboard.
- utilized SQL for efficient data extraction and querying,which allowed us to handle large volumes of banking data.
- emplyoed Excel for initial data cleaning and preparation, ensuring smooth integration with power BI. for advanced visualization.

### Data Source
Bank Data: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Finance_1.xlsx" and "Finance_2.xlsx" files, containing detailed information about members of the bank and their status.

### Tools
- SQL: Data Analysis
- Power BI and excel: data cleaning and Creating dashboards

### Data cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks.
1.Data loading and inspection.
2.Handling missing values.
3.Data cleaning and formatting.

### Data Analysis
Incudes some intersting code/ features worked with SQL.

### insights
### KPI.1
### YEAR WISE LOAN AMOUNT STATISTICS
- Here we can see the gradual growth of the loan amount with the growing year indicating healthy growth.
- Indicating in the year 2011 there is drastic change indicating high loan activity.

### KPI.2
- Sub grades in B category (specifically B4 to B5) have the highest revolving balance.This indicates that the customers with these sub grades have the most significant amount of revolving credit.
- i.e., B4 has the highest balance of $40M followed by B5 at $38M.
- sub-grades A and C categories also show relatively high revolving balance but not as high as those in B category.
- sub grades in the D,E,F and G categories also show relatively high revolving balance with a noticeable decrease as the sub grades progress from D1 to G5.

### RECOMMENDATION
- Continue to priortize and expand offering in grades A and B,specifically in sub grades A5,B4 and B5 as they bring in the most revenue.
- implement risk assessment or consider reevaluating the terms for loans in grades D,E,F and G to minimize potential losses.
- carefully increase the number of loans in the middle grades(C1 toC3) while managing the risk associated with lower grades to optimize profitability.

### KPI.3
- among 482.70M total payment,68% of the total is from verified customers,while 32% is from non-verified customers.
- so verified customers are more likely to be approved for loan and may recieve a higher loan amounts and also pay it bank.
- verification is crucial for assesing credit worthiness and managing loan default risk.Hence increasing the number of verified customers could potentially boost the total loan amount.

### RECOMMENDATION
- Reduce unverified payments by implementing sticter verification protocols.
- introduce automated tools to handle routine or small transations efficiently.
- focus verification efforts on high-value or high risk transactions to reduce potential risk.

### KPI.4
- signiicant peaks in the years 2009 and 2012 could indicate economic events influencing loan activities.
- states like CA,FC and TX are main regions with higher loan activities.

### KPI.5
- we can see the highest number of payments seems to occure in 2011 to 2014. indicating the trends where more individual are concluding thier payments.

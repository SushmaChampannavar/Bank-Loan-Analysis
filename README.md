# BANK-LOAN_ANALYSIS_PROJECT

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
- this includes the analysing bank loan data and provide insights into loan applications, funding distribution and borrower profiles across various dimensions.
- the main aim is to assist bank management in understanding loan distribution,idendifyinf risk factors, and making data-driven decisions on loan policies,marketing statergies and risk management.

### TOOLS
- Power BI : data cleaning and Creating dashboards

### DATA CLEANING /PREPARATION
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks.
1.Data loading and inspection.
2.Handling missing values.
3.Data cleaning and formatting.

### DASHBOARD OVERVIEW : it consists following visualizations
- Bar chart: "Year wise loan amount"
- Table: "state and year wise loan amount"
- Donut chart: "verification stats wise loan amount"
- Ribbon chart: "Grade and sub grade wise revolve balance"
- Line and clustered column chart: "Last payment date (year) wise home ownership status"

### INSIGHTS
### KPI.1
### YEAR WISE LOAN AMOUNT STATISTICS
- from 2007 to 2011, the total loan amount has seen a significant increase,with a peak in 2011 reaching $261M.
- this trend suggests a rapid increase in loan demand or approval rates.however,the growth was not steady,with major increases in specific years(2010-2011).
- Here we can see the gradual growth of the loan amount with the growing year indicating healthy growth.
- Indicating in the year 2011 there is drastic change indicating high loan activity.

### KPI.2
### GRADE AND SUB GRADE WISE REVOL BALANCE
- Sub grades in B category (specifically B4 to B5) have the highest revolving balance.This indicates that the customers with these sub grades have the most significant amount of revolving credit.
- i.e., B4 has the highest balance of $40M followed by B5 at $38M.
- sub-grades A and C categories also show relatively high revolving balance but not as high as those in B category.
- sub grades in the D,E,F and G categories also show relatively high revolving balance with a noticeable decrease as the sub grades progress from D1 to G5.

### KPI.3
### VERIFICATION STATUS WISE TOTAL PAYMENT
- among 482.70M total payment,68% of the total is from verified customers,while 32% is from non-verified customers.
- so verified customers are more likely to be approved for loan and may recieve a higher loan amounts and also pay it bank.
- verification is crucial for assesing credit worthiness and managing loan default risk.Hence increasing the number of verified customers could potentially boost the total loan amount.

### KPI.4
### STATE AND YEAR WISE LOAN STATUS
- signiicant peaks in the years 2009 and 2012 could indicate economic events influencing loan activities.
- states like California(CA),Florida(FC) and Texas(TX) are main regions with higher loan activities.
- States with lower ;oan counts,like Maryland(MD) and Ohio(OH),may have lower demand or more stringent approval requiremnts.

### KPI.5
### LAST PAYMENT DATE(YEAR) WISE HOUSE OWNERSHIP STATUS
- we can see the highest number of payments seems to occure in 2011 to 2014. indicating the trends where more individual are concluding thier payments.
- Borrowers with a "Mortgage" and "Rent" show the highest growth in loan counts,suggesting that these holders are a significant customer segment.
- other categories like "Own" show steady,moderate growth,while "None" and "other" remains relatively low throughout the years.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- investigate economic factors or policy changes during this period that may have influenced the rise in loan applications and funding. consider preparing for similar trends in future economic shifts.
- Focus on states with high loan counts to understand underlying factors and identify opportunities or risks.
- Since a considerable portion of loan is not verified,enhancing the verification process could reduce default risks.
- while focusing on Grade B and C borrowers might be profitable, consider diversifying into lower risk segments to balance risk exposure.incentives for responsible borrowers could also encourage more high-grade 
  applications.
- the growth in loans amoung mortgage holders could be leveraged by promoting this segment,as they may represent lower default risks.
- and additionally understanding the behaviour of non-mortgage applications(like renters) could help refine risk assessment criteria.

### CONCLUSION
- High loan demand in specific states and concentration of moderate- risk (grade B and c) borrowers,with most loans unverified,posing risks.Mortgage and rent holders dominate loan applications, suggesting tailored loan opportunities for them, while renters also show growth potential. the decline in loan activity post -2014 calls for further investigation into market trends.stregthening verification and refining loan offerings based on borrower profiles could enhance performance and risk management.
